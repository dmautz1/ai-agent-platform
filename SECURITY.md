## 🔐 Security Measures

### Platform Security

**Authentication & Authorization**
- JWT-based authentication with secure token management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session management with automatic expiration
- Secure password hashing using industry standards

**Data Protection**
- All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS 1.3)
- Database encryption at rest via Supabase
- API key encryption and secure storage
- Input validation and sanitization

**Infrastructure Security**
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scanning
- Security headers implementation (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- CORS policy enforcement
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

### AI Provider Security

**API Key Management**
- Secure environment variable storage
- API key rotation capabilities
- Provider-specific security best practices
- Network-level restrictions where supported

**Data Handling**
- No persistent storage of AI provider responses
- Minimal data forwarding to AI services
- User consent for AI processing
- Audit logging for AI interactions

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Production Security Checklist

**Environment Configuration**
```bash
# Required security settings
ENVIRONMENT=production
DEBUG=false
JWT_SECRET=<strong-32-character-secret>
SECURE_COOKIES=true
TRUSTED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com
```

**Database Security**
- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
- Use service role keys only in backend
- Regular database backups with encryption
- Access logging and monitoring

**API Security**
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- API versioning and deprecation policies
- Request/response logging (excluding sensitive data)
- Authentication on all protected endpoints

### Security Headers

X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

## 🛠️ Developer Security Guidelines

### Secure Development Practices

**Code Security**
```python
# ✅ Good: Parameterized queries
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s", (user_id,))

# ❌ Bad: SQL injection risk
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")

# ✅ Good: Input validation
@validator('email')
def validate_email(cls, v):
    if not re.match(r'^[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+$', v):
        raise ValueError('Invalid email format')
    return v

# ✅ Good: Secure API key handling
api_key = os.getenv('API_KEY')
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError('API key not configured')
```

**Authentication Security**
```python
# ✅ Good: JWT verification
def verify_token(token: str):
    try:
        payload = jwt.decode(token, SECRET_KEY, algorithms=['HS256'])
        return payload
    except jwt.ExpiredSignatureError:
        raise HTTPException(401, "Token expired")
    except jwt.InvalidTokenError:
        raise HTTPException(401, "Invalid token")
```

### Security Testing

**Automated Testing**

## 📋 Security Best Practices for Users

### For Developers

**Environment Security**
```bash
# ✅ Use strong, unique API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-unique-secret-key

# ✅ Restrict API key permissions
# Configure API key restrictions in provider dashboards

# ✅ Use environment variables, never hardcode
# ❌ api_key = "sk-proj-hardcoded-key"
# ✅ api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# ✅ Regular key rotation
# Set reminders to rotate keys quarterly
```

**Production Deployment**
```bash
# ✅ Security checklist before deployment
- [ ] All secrets in environment variables
- [ ] HTTPS enabled and enforced
- [ ] Database access restricted
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] Monitoring and logging enabled
- [ ] Backup and recovery tested
```

### For End Users

**Account Security**
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Regularly review account activity
- Report suspicious activity immediately

**Data Protection**
- Review data sharing settings
- Understand AI provider data policies
- Use minimal necessary permissions
- Regular data export and backup
